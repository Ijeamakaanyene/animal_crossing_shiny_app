# Choose Your Fighter: Animal Crossing New Horizons
Created a R Shiny app that allows you to select your personality and species and it matches you to an Animal Crossing Villager. It then provides Villager's information such as image, name, song, and catchphrase.<br><br>

Uses data from VillagerDB obtained as part of a the weekly #TidyTuesday project.<br><br>

Requires packages: `dplyr`, `gt`, `tidyr`.
